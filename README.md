# Utils

Useful modules and utility functions which I use across more than one of my sites.

I add this repo as a git submodule to use it, which gives several benefits:

- When I'm working on a project that uses this submodule, I can make changes here just as easily as anywhere else in that project's code.
- I don't need a build/compile step for this code.
- Dependencies here must be added to every project that uses that code, making dependencies more obvious and thus preventing dependency sprawl in my projects.
